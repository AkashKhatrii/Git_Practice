## This is my path to learning all about Git and Githugb!

### Steps:
1. Created a folder in my local machine
2. Initialized git with `git init`
3. Open github and created a new repo, copied its url
4. Ran `git remote add origin {url}` to set the remote repo as the newly created repo
5. Ran `git add .` to add all the untracked files to the staging area
6. `git commit` to commit changes to the remote repo, as all the changes I was doing were on my local machine.
